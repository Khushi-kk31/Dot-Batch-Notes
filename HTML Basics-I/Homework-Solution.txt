Question 1: What is Description List?

Answer: 

Description Lists are used: 
- To give definitions to particular terms that we have defined in our lists.
- To have a dictionary type of format(term and definition of term)
Description Lists are used with <dl> tag in html. 
Description terms is represented as <dt> tag and terms of data is represented as <dd> tag.

Question 2: Which html element do not have attribute?

Answer:

The HEAD element has no attributes and the start and end tag can always be safely 
omitted as they can be readily inferred by the parser. Self closing tag like <br> tag
can also be reffered to have no attribute.

Question 3: What will happen when we close an empty tag?

Answer:

Adding the closing tags to the empty elements will be invalid syntax. Empty elements are self-closing 
or void and not container tags.
